# foreignSubModule
External test repository

I now change the foreign file.

This is a change done in the host project.

New change in foreign file.

After adding 
[remote "foreignSubModuleRepo"]
	url = https://github.com/marpet/foreignSubModule.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/foreignSubModuleRepo/*
to .git/config
